The theme supports policies to improve and create sustainable rural and urban living conditions. Some populations are transitory as a result of mass immigration, refuge, or displacement by large natural disasters or war. It’s important to understand how policy and programmes impact migration and population growth, as well as economic activity, social well-being, and quality of life.",
